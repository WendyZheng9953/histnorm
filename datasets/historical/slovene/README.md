# Slovene normalization dataset

This dataset comes from the [goo300k reference corpus of historical
Slovene](http://nl.ijs.si/imp/index-en.html).  It is a
processed version of the [KonvNormSl 1.0 dataset of normalised
Slovene](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1068).

The original dataset is in one-token-per-line format with added
beginning-of-word and end-of-word markers, as well as individual characters
separated by spaces.  To keep in line with the format of the other datasets, the
version in this repo "undoes" these preprocessing decisions.
