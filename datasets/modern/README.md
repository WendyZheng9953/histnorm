# Contemporary full form wordlists

These files provide full-form wordlists of contemporary language, e.g. for use
as reference lexica for the Norma tool or to train language models for cSMTiser.

They have been created from a combination of the [Europarl v7
corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/) and a [multilingual parallel Bible
corpus](https://github.com/christos-c/bible-corpus).

Icelandic wordlists were extracted from [BÍN](http://bin.arnastofnun.is/data/)
and [MÍM](http://www.malfong.is/index.php?lang=en&pg=mim) but may not be
directly distributed due to licensing restrictions, so they are not included
here.
