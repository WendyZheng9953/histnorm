# German normalization dataset

This dataset comes from Version 5.0 of the [RIDGES (Register in Diachronic
German Science)
project](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en/institut-en/professuren-en/korpuslinguistik/research/ridges-projekt).

The two-column normalization dataset was prepared by Uwe Springmann, Bryan
Jurish, and Martin Klotz.  It is comprised of 16 texts from the corpus
originating between 1482 and 1652; newer texts were deliberately included as
they tend to show significantly less variation.  For each text, a random
70/15/15 split of sentences was performed to create the final train/dev/test
splits.
